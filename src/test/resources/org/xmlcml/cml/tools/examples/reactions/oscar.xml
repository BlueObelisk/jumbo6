			<P>It has been previously reported<REF ID="cit5b" TYPE="P">5<IT>b</IT></REF> that <chemical><formula>BF<SB>3</SB><B>·</B></formula>OEt<SB>2</SB>-treatment</chemical> of the <chemical>epoxide</chemical> <XREF ID="chem4" TYPE="COMPOUND">4</XREF> (Scheme 2) with the <chemical>acetoxy ethyl</chemical> group at the C-6 position resulted in a very slow reaction and in a low-yield formation of the C-5 diastereomer <XREF ID="chem6" TYPE="COMPOUND">6</XREF> instead of the desired compound <XREF ID="chem7" TYPE="COMPOUND">7</XREF>. Efficient preparation of <XREF ID="chem7" TYPE="COMPOUND">7</XREF> was obtained from the investigation of other Lewis acids with an <chemical>aminium</chemical> salt. Thus, treatment of the <chemical>epoxide</chemical> <XREF ID="chem4" TYPE="COMPOUND">4</XREF> with <chemical>tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium hexachloroantimonate</chemical> <XREF ID="chem9" TYPE="COMPOUND">9</XREF><REF ID="cit8" TYPE="P">8</REF> in <formula><chemical SMILES="ClCCl" InChI="InChI=1/CH2Cl2/c2-1-3/h1H2">CH<SB>2</SB>Cl<SB>2</SB></chemical></formula> was found to afford <XREF ID="chem7" TYPE="COMPOUND">7</XREF> in reasonable yield (69%) (Scheme
2). In order to accomplish the biomimetic synthesis of <XREF ID="chem1" TYPE="COMPOUND">1</XREF> in an analogous manner to the successful synthesis of <XREF ID="chem3" TYPE="COMPOUND">3</XREF>, the <chemical>acetoxy</chemical> group at the C-3 position in <XREF ID="chem4" TYPE="COMPOUND">4</XREF> was replaced by the <chemical><IT>tert</IT>-butyldimethylsilyl</chemical> (TBS) <chemical>ether</chemical> leading to <chemical>epoxide</chemical> <XREF ID="chem5" TYPE="COMPOUND">5</XREF>. The synthetic route of <chemical>mytiloxanthin</chemical> <XREF ID="chem1" TYPE="COMPOUND">1</XREF> was therefore planned through conversion of <XREF ID="chem5" TYPE="COMPOUND">5</XREF> to the <chemical>cyclopentyl ketone</chemical> <XREF ID="chem8" TYPE="COMPOUND">8</XREF> and subsequent construction of <chemical>enolic β-diketone</chemical> as shown in Scheme 2.</P>

				<XREF ID="chem11" TYPE="COMPOUND">11</XREF> (Scheme 3), acetylation followed by epoxidation with MCPBA gave <chemical>epoxides</chemical> <XREF ID="chem5a chem5b" TYPE="COMPOUND">5a,b</XREF> (<XREF ID="chem5a" TYPE="COMPOUND">5a</XREF>: 26% from <XREF ID="chem11" TYPE="COMPOUND">11</XREF>; <XREF ID="chem5b" TYPE="COMPOUND">5b</XREF>: 48% from <XREF ID="chem11" TYPE="COMPOUND">11</XREF>), in which the relative configurations between the <chemical>silyloxy</chemical> and <chemical>epoxy</chemical> groups were confirmed by <SP>1</SP>H NMR.<REF ID="cit9" TYPE="P">9</REF> The undesired isomer <XREF ID="chem5b" TYPE="COMPOUND">5b</XREF> was returned to the tetrasubstituted <chemical>olefin</chemical> <XREF ID="chem12" TYPE="COMPOUND">12</XREF> by the following deepoxidation procedure.

followed by silylation gave <XREF ID="chem12" TYPE="COMPOUND">12</XREF> in 60% yield. Reaction of <chemical><IT>anti</IT>-epoxide</chemical> <XREF ID="chem5a" TYPE="COMPOUND">5a</XREF> with <chemical>aminium</chemical> salt <XREF ID="chem9" TYPE="COMPOUND">9</XREF> provided the desired <chemical>cyclopentyl</chemical> compound <XREF ID="chem8" TYPE="COMPOUND">8</XREF> (63%) and its deprotected <chemical>alcohol</chemical> <XREF ID="chem13" TYPE="COMPOUND">13</XREF> (30%) which was easily resilylated to give <XREF ID="chem8" TYPE="COMPOUND">8</XREF> (89%). Consequently, the <chemical>cyclopentyl ketone</chemical> <XREF ID="chem8" TYPE="COMPOUND">8</XREF> was synthesized by the stereoselective rearrangement of <XREF ID="chem5a" TYPE="COMPOUND">5a</XREF> in high yield. The structure of <XREF ID="chem8" TYPE="COMPOUND">8</XREF> was determined from the following spectral data. Its IR absorption showed a new <chemical>carbonyl</chemical> frequency at 1699 cm<SP>–1</SP>. In its <SP>1</SP>H NMR spectrum, the <chemical>methylene</chemical> signal of the C-7 position appeared at <IT>δ</IT>
2.75 (t), further downfield than the corresponding signal [<IT>δ</IT> 2.01 (2H, m)] of <XREF ID="chem5a" TYPE="COMPOUND">5a</XREF>, in addition, <chemical SMILES="[H+]" InChI="InChI=1/p+1/i/hH">proton</chemical> signals on the <chemical SMILES="C1CCCC1" InChI="InChI=1/C5H10/c1-2-4-5-3-1/h1-5H2">cyclopentane</chemical> ring were observed analogous to results reported previously.<REF ID="cit5b" TYPE="P">5<IT>b</IT></REF></P>
			
			<P>Reduction of <XREF ID="chem8" TYPE="COMPOUND">8</XREF> with <formula><chemical SMILES="[Na+].[BH4-]" InChI="InChI=1/BH4.Na/h1H4;/q-1;+1">NaBH<SB>4</SB></chemical></formula> followed by protection of the resulting <chemical>hydroxy</chemical> group with <chemical><IT>p</IT>-methoxybenzyloxymethyl</chemical> (PMBM) <chemical SMILES="[Cl-]" InChI="InChI=1/ClH/h1H/p-1/fCl/h1h/q-1">chloride</chemical><REF ID="cit11" TYPE="P">11</REF> gave compound <XREF ID="chem14" TYPE="COMPOUND">14</XREF> (62% from <XREF ID="chem8" TYPE="COMPOUND">8</XREF>), which was reduced with LAH to provide the <chemical>alcohol</chemical> <XREF ID="chem15" TYPE="COMPOUND">15</XREF> (99%). This was subjected to oxidation with <chemical><IT>o</IT>-iodoxybenzoic acid</chemical><REF ID="cit12" TYPE="P">12</REF> (IBX) to yield the <chemical>aldehyde</chemical> <XREF ID="chem16" TYPE="COMPOUND">16</XREF> (93%), which was reacted with <chemical SMILES="[Li+]C=C" InChI="InChI=1/C2H3.Li/c1-2;/h1H,2H2;/q;+1" liveInChI="yes">vinyllithium</chemical> prepared from the <chemical SMILES="C=CBr" InChI="InChI=1/C2H3Br/c1-2-3/h2H,1H2" liveInChI="yes">vinyl bromide</chemical> <XREF ID="chem17" TYPE="COMPOUND">17</XREF><REF ID="cit13" TYPE="P">13</REF> and Bu<SP><IT>t</IT></SP>Li followed by oxidation with IBX to provide the <chemical>ketone</chemical> <XREF ID="chem18" TYPE="COMPOUND">18</XREF> (60% from <XREF ID="chem16" TYPE="COMPOUND">16</XREF>).

Deprotection of the PMBM group in <XREF ID="chem18" TYPE="COMPOUND">18</XREF> with DDQ<REF ID="cit11b" TYPE="P">11<IT>b</IT></REF> gave the <chemical>alcohol</chemical> <XREF ID="chem19" TYPE="COMPOUND">19</XREF> (88%), which was treated with <chemical SMILES="CS(=O)C" InChI="InChI=1/C2H6OS/c1-4(2)3/h1-2H3">DMSO</chemical> and <formula><chemical SMILES="CC(=O)OC(=O)O" InChI="InChI=1/C3H4O4/c1-2(4)7-3(5)6/h1H3,(H,5,6)">Ac<SB>2</SB>O</chemical></formula> to afford the <chemical>enolic β-diketone</chemical> <XREF ID="chem20" TYPE="COMPOUND">20</XREF> (36%) and the <chemical SMILES="CC(=O)[O-]" InChI="InChI=1/C2H4O2/c1-2(3)4/h1H3,(H,3,4)/p-1">acetate</chemical> <XREF ID="chem21" TYPE="COMPOUND">21</XREF> (33%).

The <SP>1</SP>H NMR spectrum of <XREF ID="chem20" TYPE="COMPOUND">20</XREF> had a broad
one-proton signal at <IT>δ</IT> 16.15 and a sharp one-proton resonance at <IT>δ</IT> 5.81. In addition, its IR spectrum showed an absorption at 1583 cm<SP>–1</SP> exhibiting the presence of a strongly hydrogen-bonded <chemical>carbonyl</chemical> group. These spectral data confirmed the presence of a completely <chemical>enolic β-diketone</chemical> structure. The structure of <XREF ID="chem21" TYPE="COMPOUND">21</XREF> was revealed by the following <SP>1</SP>H NMR data [an <chemical>acetoxy methyl</chemical> signal appeared at <IT>δ</IT> 2.14 (3H, s) and a <chemical SMILES="[H+]" InChI="InChI=1/p+1/i/hH">proton</chemical> signal (<IT>δ</IT> 4.23) due to C-6 shifted downfield compared to the corresponding signal (<IT>δ</IT> 4.04) of <XREF ID="chem19" TYPE="COMPOUND">19</XREF>].</P>
			<P>Unfortunately, direct conversion of <XREF ID="chem20" TYPE="COMPOUND">20</XREF> into the <chemical>C<SB>15</SB>-β-diketone aldehyde</chemical> <XREF ID="chem10a" TYPE="COMPOUND">10a</XREF> (Scheme 2) by deprotection of the <chemical>allylic</chemical> TBS group and subsequent oxidation of the resulting <chemical>alcohol</chemical> using several reagents (IBX, <formula><chemical>MnO<SB>2</SB></chemical></formula>, <IT>etc</IT>.) was unsuccessful, probably due to the instability of the <chemical>β-diketone</chemical> part. Thus, after protection of the <chemical>β-diketone</chemical> moiety in <XREF ID="chem20" TYPE="COMPOUND">20</XREF> by acetylation, the resulting <chemical SMILES="CC(=O)[O-]" InChI="InChI=1/C2H4O2/c1-2(3)4/h1H3,(H,3,4)/p-1">acetate</chemical> <XREF ID="chem22" TYPE="COMPOUND">22</XREF> was partly deprotected with TBAF to give the <chemical>allylic alcohol</chemical> <XREF ID="chem23" TYPE="COMPOUND">23</XREF> (92%) which was oxidized with IBX followed by removal of another TBS group with <formula><chemical SMILES="[H]F" InChI="InChI=1/FH/h1H">HF</chemical></formula> to afford the <chemical>C<SB>15</SB>-aldehyde</chemical> <XREF ID="chem10b" TYPE="COMPOUND">10b</XREF> (55% from <XREF ID="chem23" TYPE="COMPOUND">23</XREF>) as shown in Scheme 4. Its <SP>1</SP>H NMR spectrum showed no signal from the TBS group but it did display a pair of doublets attributable to the 11-H (<IT>δ</IT> 10.17, d, <IT>J</IT> 7.5) and 10-H (<IT>δ</IT> 6.37, d, <IT>J</IT> 7.5).</P>
