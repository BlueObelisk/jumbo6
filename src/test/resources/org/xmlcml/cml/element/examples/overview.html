    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <p>These exampes are to <b>test the code, not the data or the schema</b>.</p>
    They comprise:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>complex</tt>: one or a very few valid and static medium/large examples to multiple namespaces, performance, etc..</li>
    <li><tt>dict</tt>: one or a very few valid and static dictionaries to test CMLDictionary and the linkage of dictRef and other namespaceRef tools.</li>
    <li><tt>units</tt>: one or a very few valid and static unitLists to test CMLUnit and the linkage of units attributes.</li>
    <li><tt>xsd</tt>: small examples specifically for each schema element. This is to test that CMLNodeFactory works for each element. If it can be guaranteed, then these examples might go.</li>
    </ul>
