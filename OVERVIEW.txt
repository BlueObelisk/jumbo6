JUMBO is a library which validates and supports CML Schema. 

Specifically jumbo5.3 and 
schema2.5 mutually support each other. schema2.5 will not be changed (except for 
critical bugfixes) and there is no need (unlike previous versions) to generate the 
AbstractFoo.java classes. These are distributed with Jumbo and will not change.
	
Other versions of schema will be incompatible with jumbo5.3	

The architecture is described in docs/html/architecture

Newcomers may get started with docs/html/gettingStarted/index.html

JUMBO is now widelu used in JUMBO-converters
