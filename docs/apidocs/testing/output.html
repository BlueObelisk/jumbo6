    <h2>Test outputs</h2>
    <p>some tests output files. These will generally be found 
    under the temporary directory defined by CMLUtil.getTEMP_DIRECTORY().
    At present this is <project_root>/target/test-outputs. The files for a
    test should be found under the class name, e.g.
    {project_root}/target/test-outputs/org/xmlcml/cml/elements/CMLMolecule
    This can be constructed by CMLUtil.getTestOutputDirectory(Class)
