	    <p>
              </p><p>Namespaces are fundamental to modern global information. They give complete â€œownershipâ€? to the <em>names</em> in a document.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a typical problem: If I write</p>
<pre>&amp;lt;element&gt;oxygen&amp;lt;/element&gt;&lt;!--&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;element--&gt;</pre>
<p>youâ€™ll all know what this means, right? But if I describe the molecule element in my my schema by:</p>
<pre>&amp;lt;element name="molecule"&gt;...&lt;!--&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;element--&gt;</pre>
<p>thatâ€™s also OK. The software has no way of telling that the first
relates to chemistry and the second to XML schemas. So we have to <em>disambiguate</em> them by adding unique names.</p>
<p>In Java this is common - an import in JUMBO might be:</p>
<p><tt>import org.xmlcml.cml.element.CMLBond;</tt></p>
<p>Because all domain names are guaranteed to be unique we know it
wonâ€™t clash with any other package anywhere, anytime. The method that
the W3C has chosen for XML documents is slightly more convoluted. They
also use the domain name in a <em>namespaceURI</em> such as</p>
<p><tt>http://www.xml-cml.org/schema</tt></p>
<p>Henry and I own the domain name so no-one else can use this
namespace. (Thereâ€™s actually no physical protection but it just doesnâ€™t
make sense to use someone elseâ€™s DN). <strong>NOTE: this is a NAME, NOT an ADDRESS</strong>.
The namespaceURI is a very bad design - it would have been easy to use
something other than http: but that is how things have turned out.</p>
<p>I have to stress this. The namespaceURI does NOT link to anything,
any more than â€œPeter Murray-Rustâ€? addresses me. It identifies me, but
does not locate me. Similarly â€œChemistry Laboratory, Cambridge, CB2
1EW, UKâ€? is my address, not my name. It allows you to locate me, not to
identify me. The use of â€œhttp:â€? for a name is absurd, but it is with us
for ever.<br>
Second, it would be nice to use the namespaceURI to create a fully
qualified name. Java does this by having a name (e.g. CMLBond.class)
and a fully-qualified name (org.xmlcml.cml.element.CMLBond.class).
There are rules for when you can omit the package name. Unfortunately
in XML the FQName cannot be created by lexical composition as the URI
has non-XML characters. Oh dear! So the design is in two stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>abbreviate the namespaceURI to a (normally short) prefix which can be prepended.</li>
<li>formally associate the prefix with the URI</li>
</ul>
<p>Ponderous, but manageable. Then the next bit of unfortunate design -
make the association look exactly like an XML attribute but give it
different semantics. Now we have the whole lot:</p>
<pre>&amp;lt;cml:cml xmlns:cml="http://www.xml-cml.org/schema"&gt;</pre>
<pre>&amp;lt;cml:molecule title="benzene"/&gt;</pre>
<pre>&amp;lt;cml:cml&gt;</pre>
<p>The first  line states:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <tt>xmlns:cml=â€?http://www.xml-cml.org/schemaâ€?</tt>  string associated the prefix  <tt>cml</tt> with the namespaceURI <tt>http://www.xml-cml.org/schema</tt> (which is owned by CML)</li>
<li>the <tt>cml:cml</tt> element belongs to the the namespaceURI <tt>http://www.xml-cml.org/schema</tt>. At this stage all you know is that we can uniquify the element - there is no central registry that says that â€œCML owns <tt>http://www.xml-cml.org/schema</tt>â€? - you have to find that out by social means. <tt>cml:cml</tt> is called a <tt>QName</tt>.</li>
<li>there is no need to repeat the namespaceURI on every element. The
second line inherits the assignment from the first. But the prefix is
always required.</li>
<li>the prefix is a dummy. Thus the semantics of</li>
</ul>
<pre>&amp;lt;foo:cml xmlns:foo="http://www.xml-cml.org/schema"&gt;</pre>
<pre>&amp;lt;foo:molecule title="benzene"/&gt;</pre>
<pre>&amp;lt;foo:cml&gt;</pre>
<p>are identical although the documents are lexically distinct. Itâ€™s
useful to use â€œcmlâ€? as prefix as it makes the document easier for
humans to read and weâ€™ll try to use mnemonic QNames.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not worry about attributes at this stage. Although it is
possible and sometimes necessary to add namespaces to attribute names
you wonâ€™t find this in normal CML.</li>
<li>However you <em>will</em> find namespaces in attribute and other
values. This is a key part of the CML dictionary, units and metadata
design. But thatâ€™s another day.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should always find a CML namespaceURI in CML documents. In the
past we have sometimes omitted them as namespaces were not originally
part of XML. But now itâ€™s effectively mandatory. So you - or your tools
- will need to memorise the CML namespaceURI if you create documents
that use CML.</p>
<p><strong>Versions</strong></p>
<p>3-4 years ago ee thought we could be clever and describe different
functions and versions of CML by different namespaces, such as</p>
<p><tt>http://www.xml-cml.org/cml2/core</tt></p>
<p>meaning the core part of CML version 2. Unfortunately this causes
massive problems - every piece of software has to recognise every
namespace and if it ever changes <em>all</em> the software immediately breaks. So we announced a simplification this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>There would only ever be one namespaceURI for CML names.</li>
<li>If we need to know versions we would add a version attribute. This
will have to be allowable on any element as any element can be the
root. We would not allow mixed versions!</li>
</ul>
<p>This change was made - various collaborators (rightly) said it must never be changed again.</p>
<p>The reason itâ€™s important is that software relies on the
namespaceURI to identify the language. If I read a document and find
that the NS-URI is</p>
<p><tt>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</tt></p>
<p>I know it is an SVG1.1 document. (Try using it as a URL - which it
isnâ€™t - and you will get a small page announcing that it is the
namespace. This is good default behaviour - not all NS-URIs can do
this).</p>
<p>So I can now combine SVG and CML and you will start to see compound documents in following posts</p>
<p>P.

                What is a CML Document like? - September 3rd, 2006 
              </a>
              <hr>
	    </div>

	    <p>
              </p><p>First let me congratulate Egon on starting his discussion of <a target="_blank" title="CML explained" href="http://cmlexplained.blogspot.com/2006/08/cml-explained.html">CML Explained</a> - in my posts Iâ€™ll try to be complementary. There are several aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is a definitive view on a CML construct?</li>
<li>how do I create CML to represent concept X (including tutorial)</li>
<li>what tools are there?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>File formats</strong></p>
<p>Here Iâ€™m commenting on the very different approach that CML takes to traditional chemical information which you can see on <a title="chemical file format on WP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_file_format">Chemical File Format</a>
on Wikipedia. (I shall rely increasingly on WP to explain things). In
this youâ€™ll see that there are tens if not hundreds of file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Program formats</strong></p>
<p>These normally arise because a software developer needs a format to
export and import information from their system. The format is designed
to hold the information necessary to support the state of the system so
that it can be re-read at a later stage. Typical systems that do this
are compoutational chemistry programs (where more computational cycles
may be required) and chemical editors or modelling programs. In general
these formats are program-specific (sometimes manufacturer-specific).
There have been times when the formats were seen as trade secrets and,
in general manufacturers have not worked hard towards interoperability
- where program A can read the output of program B from a different
manufacturer.</p>
<p>Because of the effort to write software most authors see their
system as the local centre of their universe. Design for
interoperability has been low. There is no easy way that (say) the
output of GAMESS can be directly read into Gaussian or vice. This has
led either to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a series of Foo2Bar converters - specialist codes to link two large
systems. The problem here is that there have to be N(N-1)/2 converters
for N programs, and also that it is boring, especially to maintain so
that such converters are incomplete and decay.</li>
<li>generic converters (especially from the BlueObelisk interoperabilty
movement) such as OpenBabel or libraries such as CDK, JOELib and JUMBO.</li>
</ul>
<p>CML has been heaviliy informed by these exercises. We take the
approach: â€œHere is an important program; how much of the output can CML
capture? and what is the information loss?â€? So CML attempts to address
much of the information described on the File Formats page.</p>
<p>In practice there is a lot not captured as many programs expose
parts of their internal data structure but without clear semantics.
This is compounded by shorthand poorly documented fields, especially in
the input of programs. Complete interoperability between existing
programs is probably impossible, but the next generation of CML-aware
programs will help to tackle this.</p>
<p><strong>Data formats</strong></p>
<p>Several commendable communal efforts have created data formats which
are independent of the software that is expected to produce of process
them. Historically the two most important areas were crystal structures
(CIF and PDB) and spectroscopy (JCAMP). The latter is now being
addressed by the AnIML group. These are developed to</p>
<ul>
<li>aid interoperability between different suppliers (e.g. a JCAMP output by manufacturer-A should be readable by manufacturer B</li>
<li>add semantic markup - making it clear exactly what a field means</li>
<li>act as a means for archival (very strong in crystallography)</li>
<li>act as a tool for authors to deposit their experimental information at time of publication or elsewise.</li>
</ul>
<p>petermr has been part of the CIF effort for many years and the CIF
process and structure has heavily informed the developed of CML. CIF
and JCAMP were developed before XML and - in an ideal world - will
benefit from conversion, but it is extremely difficult to convert
formats in a large community. Thus although mmCIF is a more extensible
format, many protein crystallographers still use PDB.<br>
<strong> Documents</strong></p>
<p>The other major motivation for CML is to create semantically rich
living publications. The current method of publication uses a
paper-like layout which would not have seemed strange to Kekule and
Beilstein 150 years ago. Yet the rest of the world is adopting
Google-based mashups, instant online information, textable videos, etc.
In chemistry if we want to know the height of a peak in a spectrum we
have to print the paper and measure it with a ruler. Despite the fact
that it used to be digital when it was measured</p>
<p>So CML is designed to help create compound documenst which include
chemistry. A typical chemistry paper, as I have blogged, contains text,
references, chemistry, maths and diagrams. All of these are expressible
in XML and Iâ€™m hoping to demonstrate some of this at the ACS meeting in
a weekâ€™s time.<br>
<strong> Compound documents</strong></p>
<p>In general a document including CML may have chunks of XHTML, MathML
and SVG. Therefore we have to distinguish between them by namespaces.
Weâ€™ll show this in a subsequent post, but we note here that in general
all CML documents should include the namespace:</p>
<p>http://www.xml-cml.org/schema</p>
<p>This is a unique name on the planet and serves to indicate the material is CML.</p>
<p>There is no required format for a CML document, but it may turn out
useful to start it with &lt;cml&gt;. However itâ€™s perfectly allowed to
start it with &lt;molecule&gt;, &lt;spectrum&gt; or any other CML
element. Thus the smallest CML document might look like:</p>
<p>&lt;cml xmlns=â€?http://www.xml-cml.org/schemaâ€?/&gt;</p>
<p>This is the â€œhello worldâ€? of CML. It says â€œI am a CML documentâ€?. Hereâ€™s a more chemical one:</p>
<p>&lt;molecule title=â€?benzeneâ€? xmlns=â€?http://www.xml-cml.org/schemaâ€?/&gt;</p>
<p>It says â€œI am a CML molecule element with a title whose value is
â€˜benzeneâ€™â€?. It doesnâ€™t tell us what benzene is, and weâ€™ll look at ways
of doing that later. But it could be a useful piece of markup in some
running scientific text.</p>
<p>Next post will address namespacesâ€¦<br>

                How do I start with CML? - September 2nd, 2006 
              </a>
              <hr>
	    </div>

	    <p>
              </p><p>CML
is a large and complicated edifice and because itâ€™s run on an Open and
meritocratic basis relies on voluntary contributions and goodwill.
Thatâ€™s sustained it for 10 years (it started in ca 1994 when Henry cam
back from WW2 with the advice that we should be using SGML and so CML
was born.) This is the first of a set of tutorial-like posts that will
help to get you started. If you come in some time after this post we
suggest you read from the earliest first.</p>
<p><em>(Note: We started blogging yesterday so havenâ€™t worked out the
fine details of compound documents including images. Later posts should
look prettier.)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Firstly, what is CML? </strong></p>
<p>Technically CML is an application of XML defined by an XSD schema.
In that schema is some human-readable and some machine-processible
documentation describing the semantics. Formally thatâ€™s all <img src="blog1_files/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"> . Not very exciting</p>
<p>In practice, however, CML is a completely new way of formalising
chemical information. It is NOT â€œjust another file formatâ€?. Itâ€™s a
formal way of describing a large number of chemical concepts and itâ€™s
probably correct to say it can support most of what is presented in
undergraduate chemistry. This isnâ€™t trivial, but itâ€™s possible. So you
could probably write an undergraduate textbook in CML. We (Henry and I)
have written peer-reviewed articles in CML.<br>
Weâ€™ll use the term <em>semantics</em> a lot. It means ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">see Wikipedia</a>) <em>aspects of <a title="Meaning" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning">meaning</a> that are expressed in a <a title="Language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language">language</a>, <a title="Code" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">code</a>, or other form of representation. </em>So when we we write <tt>&lt;molecule&gt;</tt> in CML, we also have to explain its semantics - i.e. what it means. This is a major challenge because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone agrees on the meaning! This may seem strange but itâ€™s very common. Thatâ€™s why formal resources such as <a href="http://www.chemsoc.org/cgi-shell/empower.exe?DB=goldbook">IUPACâ€™s Gold Book</a>
or Wikipedia are so important. So, for example, in our MaCIE database
(see below) we have taken the definitions of things like â€œClaisen
Condensationâ€?, â€œOverall Reactionâ€?, â€œReactive Centreâ€? directly from the
GoldBook. That immediately ensures we share our concepts directly with
a large number of other chemists and in some cases with everyone. The
use of dictionaries (sometimes called ontologies) is fundamental to CML
and youâ€™ll see many examples.</li>
<li>It is very difficult to formalize semantics. Even with a clear
definition, not everyone will agree on whether a given system adheres
to it. Thus even if we agree on the definition of â€œaldehydeâ€? (as
containing RC(=O)H), we might disagree whether formyl derivatives
(H(C=O)X) are aldehydes. Humans will normally make reasonable
judgements in most cases, but machines cannot. Therefore we need clear,
unambiguous machine-enforceable rules. For example we require that a
chemical element symbol in a CML document must be in the IUPAC list. A
document with, say, elementType=â€?Pheâ€? is <em>invalid</em>.</li>
<li>Although a few rules can be expressed in XML syntax (we use
something called XSD) most cannot. So we have to do this by the
following approaches:</li>
<ul>
<li>additional CML-specific XML which is machine-enforceable (we might use the Schematron syntax or RDF).</li>
<li>human-readable documentation. This is important and we continue to write it, but it isnâ€™t machine-enforceable</li>
<li>examples. There are hundreds of hand-crafted examples to illustrate
CML and hundreds of thousands of other machine-generated documents</li>
<li>code. It is often easier to write code to express rules than to
formalise them. Unfortunately itâ€™s correspondingly harder to extract
the rules from code.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Because of this CML consists of several components:</p>
<ul>
<li>a formal specification (the Schema). This is the ultimate reference.</li>
<li>a conformance-testing mechanism (JUMBO). This is a series of Java
modules written specifically to test CML instances and validate both
them and the schema.</li>
<li>libraries. When you use CML you will almost certainly have to use
code - and the best way to build applications is to use pre-written
libraries. Examples of these are CDK, JUMBO, and JOELib (all from the
Blue Obelisk)</li>
<li>applications. Although a prime use of CML is to represent chemical
information, itâ€™s often necessary to have applications that â€œdo
somethingâ€? with the documents.</li>
<li>a set of neighbouring disciplines. CML deliberately interoperates with other languages such as MathML, XHTML and SVG.</li>
<li>a community. This is perhaps the most exciting aspect of CML - a
group of people who are trying to work out how to represent a
discipline and what to do with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications of CML</p>
<p>Here are two examples of CML which you can understand without knowling how the details of CML work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MACiE</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>John Mitchell, Gemma Holliday, Daniel Almonacid and I
have developed a representation of enzyme reactions which would have
been impossible without CML. Each entry consists of many reaction
steps, and each of these can have many components and associated
information. This type of approach is really only possible with markup
languages.</p>
<p>The data data on each reaction can be queried,e.g. â€œwhich reactions
have more that 3 productsâ€?, â€œwhich involve the breaking of a C-O bondâ€?,
â€œwhich involve a histidine catalystâ€?. XML provodes many tools so that
these are easy to answer with standard tools.</p>
<p>But there are exciting new possibilities. XML has an application,
SVG, that supports animation. Reactions, being dynamic processes should
really be displayed as such. So we can show that by transforming the
CML to SVG, again using standard XML technology (in this case with
Java).</p>
<p><em>Demo:</em></p>
<p>Open the <a href="http://www-mitchell.ch.cam.ac.uk/macie/"><br>
MACiE home page</a>
at http://www-mitchell.ch.cam.ac.uk/macie/. It will display in any
browser, but if you want to see the animation youâ€™ll need IE as FireFox
doesnâ€™t yet do animations. Click â€œ100 Entriesâ€? and then â€œM0001â€³ (or any
other reaction). Youâ€™ll see something like</p>
<p><img alt="MACiE reaction M0001" id="image5" src="blog1_files/macie.htm"></p>
<p>This has been drawn automatically from the CML. A more complex example is shown in the second step:<img title="Step 2" alt="Step 2" src="blog1_files/macie1.htm" width="1"></p>
<p><img id="image6" alt="Step 2" src="blog1_files/macie1_002.htm"></p>
<p>If you are now in IE browser, follow the â€œAnimated Reactionâ€? and you
start to see the whole reaction in dynamic form. All reactions have
several steps, so there is a lot to see. A typical step might look like:<img title="Step 2" alt="Step 2" src="blog1_files/macie1.htm" width="600"></p></blockquote>
<p><img id="image7" alt="Final step" src="blog1_files/macie2.htm"></p>
<p>Here the software has been able to work out that only the Glu 147
and Cys 178 are actually changed in the reaction, so the other
spectators have been greyed out. So far we havenâ€™t worked out whether
the blogging software can support SVG, let alone animations, so weâ€™ve
had to show a snapshot. However if you have IE6 and load the animations
in MACiE you will have seen a proton move from Glu to Cys in this step.</p>
<ul>
<li>DSpace</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The second example is from our institutional archive in
Cambridge, DSpace. This allows any object to be stored, especially if
itâ€™s in XML. We had a project 2 years ago in which we computed the
properties of 250, 000 molecules. Normally this data would now be lost,
but we transformed it into CML and deposited it. Because XML is
â€œfuture-proofedâ€? it is easy to get it out again. Have a look at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/183611"><br>
http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/183611</a></p>
<p>and note the metadata under full details:</p>
<p>http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/183611?mode=full</p>
<p>CML is the only technology which would allow chemistry to be stored and retrieved in this way.  Now download the file:<br>
<a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/183611/1/nsc383501_original.cml"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/183611/1/nsc383501_original.cml">http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/183611/1/nsc383501_original.cml</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a CML file, with a molecule and its properties calculated by
MOPAC. If you want to view it, youâ€™ll need a CML-aware viewer such as
Jmol from http://jmol.sf.net - download the latest jmol.jar, run/click
it and simply load the CML file when you should see something like:</p>
<p><img alt="Jmol and CML" id="image8" src="blog1_files/jmol.htm"></p>
<p>If you donâ€™t know how to download Jmol donâ€™t be afraid to ask.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s enough for now - hope it gives an idea that CML can do exciting things that other systems cannot do.</p>
<p>P.

                Welcome to CML - September 1st, 2006 
              </a>
              <hr>
	    </div>

	    <p>
              </p><p>Welcome
to the CML blog! This is the first posting and will cover some general
principles and procedures. We hope you will respond with comments - but
they will be public! In the medium term we hope that the blog can
concentrate and formalise much of the usage and semantics of CML. The
blog does not supersede the cml-discuss list, but may be more spam free
and should allow better navigation of topics.<br>
This blog is offered to anyone interested in CML and more generally
aspects of XML for physical sciences. CML is an information design
which covers a large area of general chemistry and has several
complementary aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">formalisation of the 	semantics of chemistry</span>.
Before XML there has not been a simple way of doing this; although some
OO libraries have been built, they have not been widely
distributed.(excepting the Blue Obelisk community). The development of
dictionaries is a major step forward in physical science for semantic
interoperability.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> support for datuments</span>
(combinations of data and documents). Conventionally chemical
publications separate the text and data (the latter often as supporting
information). In practice, however, most chemical data are lost. We
believe that datuments will help to prevent this and allow archival for
posterity.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">interoperability with 	other languages</span>. Most chemical datuments will contain some or all of 	the following (with supporting technology indicated):
<ul>
<li>text (XHTML)</li>
<li>maths (MathML)</li>
<li>graphics (SVG, PNG)</li>
<li>chemistry (CML, AnIML, ThermoML)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">computational 	chemistry</span>.
There are now several programs which write CML, especially in ab initio
and solid state domains. This allows users of the programs to analyse
and display their results with much greater ease than before. It also
makes it relatively easy to chain programs so that workflows can be
built for automatic processing.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">learning objects</span>. CML 	is designed to allow annotation suitable for learning activities and to 	provide a wide range of different displays.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">knowledge aggregation</span>.
Because CML uses a consistent set of markup it is possible to aggregate
datuments and extract common concepts. Thus a series of journal
articles in CML could be searched to extract all the melting points,
spectra, reactions, etc</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">repurposing and 	styling</span>.
Because XML emphasizes the separation of content and style, different
stylesheets can be applied to the same datument. This means that, say,
an article can be written independently of a target journal and can be
restyled to fit the requirements. We already work with publishers who
see the CML datument as part of the primary representation of the
scientific article</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an increasing community of use in CML and this blog will
address some of the common hopes and concerns. Some of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>what does CML cover and not cover?</li>
<li>what would I gain from using CML? Is it worth the effort?</li>
<li>are there sufficient CML-aware tools to do what I need?</li>
<li>do any commercial organisations use or support CML?</li>
<li>how do I start using CML?</li>
</ul>
<p>Iâ€™ll answer the first in the next postâ€¦</p>
<h2>Mechanics of the blog</h2>
<p>This blog was inspired by Andrew Walkingshaw and colleagues. Itâ€™s one of a series and Iâ€™ll include the others in my <em>blogroll</em>.
This is the only blog devoted to a single topic; I have another
personal blog (â€?petermrâ€™s blogâ€?) which will cover many aspects of the
current scientific web including technology, Openness and information
design.</p>
<p>We hope that this blog will act as one of the mechanisms for
â€œdocumentingâ€? CML - i.e. the discussion here may inform the use and
design of CML.</p>
<p>We welcome anyone as a poster but require them to register (to
prevent spam). We honour copyright, but ask that posters make there
contributions available under Creative Commons. This allows the posters
to retain their moral rights, but allows us to re-use the blog
(including their contributions) for other purposes if required (e.g.
for CML documentation, tutorials, etc.). We will always attribute
posters.</p>
<p>Please let us know your ideas.
