    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    This paper describes Chemical Markup Language and its relationship to IUPAC
    and other organisations 

    <h2>1. Overview of XML and CML</h2>
    XML eXtensible Markup Language (XML) was developed by the World Wide Web
    Consortium (W3C) from 1997 onwards as a means for describing and validating
    complex documents. It is a formal subset of SGML (ISO-8879:1986) and
    completely compliant with SGML; it can be regarded as "SGML-lite". It
    emphasizes, but is not limited to, the transmission and processing of
    documents over networks. XML became a Recommendation (the final product of
    the W3C process) on 1998-02-14 and is now ubiquitous in all areas of the
    computing environment. 

    <p>XML was originally designed for complex documents for which HTML is too
    fragile, and especially to support e-commerce (B2C) and
    business-to-business (B2B) processes. However it has also proved to be very
    valuable for "non-document" content, such as data, business logic, message
    wrapping, and many aspects of middleware. It was designed to emphasise
    content over presentation, and the W3C anticipated that communities would
    create their own vocabularies as with SGML. These are defined in Document
    Type Definitions (DTDs) and often a DTD symbolises a markup language; thus
    the XHTML DTD represents the XML variant of HyperText Markup Language
    (XHTML).</p>

    <p>The W3C has developed and continues to develop a wide range of generic
    protocols based on the XML syntax. We may loosely refer to these as the
    "XML family" or even "XML". They include a small number of content-based
    MLs including:</p>

    <p>MathML for semantic and presentational mathematics SVG for Scalable
    Vector Graphics, SMIL for Synchronised (streamed) Multimedia. However, in
    general, the W3C does not create domain-based MLs, leaving that to
    appropriate individuals and authorities within domains.</p>

    <p>The W3C has created a large and powerful set of protocols layered in
    XML. These provide generic functionality required for locating, processing,
    and interpreting XML documents. All these protcols are effectively "part of
    XML" and available to any author of an ML; we have taken great care that
    CML can re-use these protocols and tools. They include:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>RDF for metadata discovery</li>

      <li>XSLT for document transformation</li>

      <li>XSL-FO for high performance document formatting and printing XLink
      for hypermedia (links)</li>

      <li>XML Schemas for document and data validation (superset of DTDs) XML
      Query language specification Namespaces in XML</li>

      <li>Digital signatures and encryption</li>
    </ol>
    XML has now become "the official metalanguage" for many communities,
    including governmental and international organisations. Thus Drug
    Regulatory Authorities (DRAs) are now actively promoting XML for the
    support of New Drug Applications (NDAs). Where "chemistry" is required, CML
    is seen as the appropriate tool to use. 

    <h2>2. Chemical Markup Language (CML).</h2>

    <h3>Historical Development</h3>
    The origins of domain specific scientific (i.e. non-bibliographic) markup
    languages can traced at least as far as the first World-Wide Web conference
    (WWW1) held at CERN in May 1994, when a session on the future of HTML
    developed into a discussion of how Mathematics and Chemistry might be
    expressed. In late 1994 this took clearer form with the suggestion by HSR
    that the output of a data-rich modelling program such as MOPAC as relating
    to molecules, atoms, bonds and their computed properties should be marked
    up in SGML. A prototype CML browser written in Tcl/Wish was produced by
    PM-R and <a href="http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/cml/">a poster</a> describing CML,
    together with a working demonstration of a modified version of MOPAC
    capable of reading and writing CML, was presented at the 1995 ACS August
    meeting in Chicago. CML was further formalised when an SGML DTD was defined
    and subsequently published on the official SGML list comp.text.sgml by PM-R
    in 1996. It included another language ("TecML") for the representation of
    general scientific data. In mid 1996, the introduction of Java by Sun
    Microsystems meant a platform independent approach to implementation could
    be taken, and the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">JUMBO</b> browser was written by PM-R and widely
    demonstrated. The XML project was started by W3C in 1996, and PMR was
    invited to be a member of the XML-WG. In January 1997 he and HSR set up the
    <a href="http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hypermail/xml-dev/">XML-DEV mailing
    list</a> to support the development of XML and XML-based tools; a list
    which received some 22,000 postings in its first three years and has around
    2000 subscribers. CML was recast and became the first XML DTD (in any
    domain); a working demo was presented to WWW6 (1997) by Jon Bosak ("father
    of XML"). CML was mentioned in the first "ChemWeb" virtual lecture by HSR and
    some 500  participants attended the "Launch of Chemical Markup
    Language", the title of the second such lecture given by PM-R on February 4,
    1998. CML catalysed the development of "non-textual" DTDs and is frequently
    cited in the XML literature. Version 1.0 of the CML specification was
    formally published in 1999. 

    <h3>Relationship to the XML Community</h3>

    <p>The XML community has a very strong tradition of encouraging prototype
    implementations of protocols and CML evolved in this way. There has always
    been CML-aware software, frequently published as "<b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">JUMBO</b>" and made available
    as open source.</p>

    <p>CML deliberately does not cover all chemistry but concentrates on
    "molecules" (discrete entities representatable by a formula and usually a
    connection table). It supports a hierarchy for compound molecules
    (clathrates, macromolecules, etc.). It also supports reactions, and
    macromolcular strucures/sequences (though it can interoperate with other
    macromolecular XML languages as they are developed). It has no specific
    support for physicochemical concepts, but can support labelled numeric
    datatypes of several sorts which can cover a wide range of requirements. It
    allows quantities and properties to be specifically attached to molecules,
    atoms or bonds.</p>

    <p>CML is designed to interoperate with several leading MLs and XML
    protocols and we have demonstrated the following</p>

    <ol>
      <li>XHTML for text and images</li>

      <li>SVG for line diagrams, graphs, reaction schemes, phase diagrams,
      etc.</li>

      <li>PlotML for graphs MathML for equations</li>

      <li>XLink for hypermedia (including atom-spectralPeak assignments,
      reaction mapping).</li>

      <li>RDF and Dublin Core for metadata</li>

      <li>XML Schemas for numeric and other data types</li>
    </ol>
    There are other generic tools required in physical science including units,
    multidimensional arrays with varied datatypes, terminology and
    bibliography. There are no widely accepted MLs for these at present; we
    shall continue to develop our own to be used with CML but will use others
    if they become widespread. An example is physiochemical data held as SELF
    (Prof. Henry Kehiaian, IUPAC+CODATA) and now converted to SELFML (PMR+HK)
    as a IUPAC/CODATA project. 

    <h2>3. Extensibility</h2>
    XML languages are extensible in that they represent a set of documents as
    well as rigidly prescribed formats. Thus CML can represent any of the
    current "legacy" molecular formats, but can also describe a complete
    chemical publication (v.i.). We have designed CML to be flexible enough to
    support many uses (v.i.) There are mechanisms (DTD, Schema, XSLT
    stylesheets, DOM) to support rigidity or allow flexibilty as required. A
    key part of CML's design is the linking to XML-based terminologies and
    ontologies. 

    <h2>4. Uses of CML</h2>
    Because XML now supports "documents" and "data" in a seamless spectrum, CML
    is applicable to all aspects of chemical informatics, data-handling and
    publication. Examples which we have prototyped include: 

    <ol>
      <li><b>datafiles:</b> e.g. support for the IUCr's CIF and the Protein
      Data Bank formats reports</li>

      <li><b>publications:</b> v.i.</li>

      <li><b>compound data cards:</b> The SELFML project associates many
      molecules and mixtures with complex physicochemical properties Materials
      Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)</li>

      <li><b>molecules:</b> we can convert losslessly from many legacy formats,
      including MDLMolfile, Sybil MOL2, JME, XYZ, SMILES, PDB and CIF.
      reactions</li>

      <li><b>logfiles from computational chemistry:</b>e.g. postprocessors for
      Gaussian, MOPAC, VAMP</li>

      <li><b>instrumental output;</b> conversion of JCAMP-DX to XML and many
      more.</li>
    </ol>
    Conversion of these applications to XML has a dramatic effect on the ease
    of processing, searching, maintenance, re-use and many other aspects. 

    <h2>5. CML and IUPAC</h2>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    We have been invited to present CML to IUPAC committees: 

    <ol>
      <li>CPEP (Oxford, 1998) An early version of CML was demonstrated and the
      potential value of converting the GoldBook to XML was shown.</li>

      <li>Nomenclature (Washington, 2000). As part of the IChI project PMR
      attended the IUPAC meeting in Washington.</li>
    </ol>
    In addition we are invited members of the IUPAC IChI group. 

    <h3>Relationship to IChI</h3>
    All XML languages make fundamental use of the concept of identifiers
    (formally, the ID attribute) to address components. An essential component
    of the CML language which requires such identification is the
    &lt;molecule&gt; element. We strongly believe that both the CML and the
    IChI projects have much scope for mutual benefit. 

    <h2>6. CML and the publication process</h2>
    SGML or XML are now the <i>de facto</i> languages for technical publishing
    and chemical publishers are experienced in them. The CML DTD specifically
    supports the publication of "chemical" information and we have pioneered
    (with the RSC and the ACS) the use of CML in the process. The RSC office
    was able to manage XML/CML submissions and we therefore note that there is
    an ongoing and evolving process for electronic and paper publication. XML
    supports high-quality (e-)print through its XSL-FO specification; generic
    XML content is transformed to an abstract print format ("Formatting
    Objects") which is then automatically converted to HTML, PDF, PostScript,
    TeX or any other format. 

    <p>Chemical information is often rendered graphically and CML supports this
    through conversion to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). CML/SVG will support
    2-D chemical presentation (molecules and reaction schemes) and can be
    integrated with XSL-FO.</p>

    <h2>7. Implementability and software</h2>
    To ensure the specification can be implemented we have created test
    implementations, with OpenSource software. All implementations are modular
    and include: 

    <ol>
      <li>CMLDOM-JS: A Javascript implementation of the main components of CML
      JUMBO3-JS. A Javascript (in-browser) tool to retrieve and display
      documents containing CML elements.</li>

      <li>SELFML-JS browser. This (Javascript) tool reads one or more SELFML
      files and displays them, including the emedded CML describing the
      compounds</li>

      <li>CMLDOM-J. A complete Java implementation of the CML-DOM, extensible
      to further refinements of CML, developed in parallel with the OMG
      project.</li>

      <li>JUMBO3-J. A Java browser for any document containing CML elements
      including 2D and 3D displays.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chimeral/" title="Chimeral">Chimeral</a>. Working examples of large CML-based
      documents and scientific articles which use an XSLT stylesheet component
      library and applets for viewing.</li>

      <li>OpenScience Projects. The OpenScience project to communally develop
      chemical software tools includes two which have been early adopters of
      CML; JMol and JChemPaint.</li>

      <li>JME Editor. We are collaborating with the developer of JME (Java
      Molecular Editor) to create a CML-aware 2D chemical structure
      editor.</li>

      <li>JMVS. This is a Java3D-based CML-compliant molecular visualiser.</li>

      <li>JChemDig and JChemAgent. Web-based robots which can traverse a remote
      Site, identify chemical content based on chemical MIME types and create a
      CML-based database of these files, including derived metadata.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chimeral/documents/validate/">JChemValidate</a>.
      An online resource for converting to and digitally signing CML
      documents.</li>
    </ol>

    </ol>
    CML is also described in a number of other articles and reviews written by
    us and others (See supporting documents <a href="http://www.xml-cml.org/information/SS-bib.pdf" title="SciFinder Scholar search for CML">SS-bib.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.xml-cml.org/information/ISI-bib.pdf" title="ISI Search for CML.">ISI-bib.pdf</a>). 

    <h3>Press coverage</h3>
    CML has been reviewed in Science, Nature, New Scientist and Scientific
    American. 

    <h3>XML monographs</h3>
    Many monographs (probably over 30) about XML review CML, some devoting
    complete chapters to it. CML is reviewed on the definitive OASIS/Cover XML
    resource at <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/">http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/</a>
    

    <h2>9. Invited Presentations</h2>
    Both PMR and HSR have been invited on many occasions to present talks
    describing CML and its applications at International conferences, including
    e.g. four at ACS national meetings and one at a CSA meeting. 

    <h2>10. Relation to other standards and organisations</h2>
    When they exist CML re-uses other standards rather than re-invent
    approaches (v.s. for examples). CML is itself a fully conforming
    application of XML. 

    <ol>
      <li>CMLDOM/OMG: CMLDOM (v.s.) has been chosen for the core of the Life
      Sciences Research group of the Object Management Group (OMG). CMLDOM is
      therefore consistent with an object-based approach to chemistry. Care has
      been taken in the design to ensure that CMLDOM is extensible without
      breaking this core.</li>

      <li>MatML: (Material Markup Language). PMR is a virtual member of the
      working group to develop a materials markup language (at NIST) and CML
      will be used in this where chemistry is required.</li>

      <li>CODATA/SELF: PMR has been invited to present XML and CML at CODATA
      meeting(s). CML is an integral part of the SELFML IUPAC/CODATA project
      (v.s.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>11. Adoption of CML</h2>
    Many different types of organisation have adopted, or are adopting CML. We
    list a few examples: 

    <ol>
      <li>Governmental and global agencies (e.g. drug regulatory agencies
      through the International Committee on Harmonisation (ICH/M2)). We have
      had additional meetings or discussions with several other agencies.
      Non-profit research (government). National Cancer Institute,
      Developmental Therapeutics program (NCI/DTP). ca. 500K compounds are
      being converted to CML Non-profit research (academia).</li>

      <li>The University of California at San Diego (UCSD) has adopted CML as
      the chemical technology for its new terascale information and computing
      grid portals. This will also by used by the Protein Data Bank (PDB) at
      the same site.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Software companies.</h3>
    Four companies (names withheld because of confidentiallity) are
    collaborating with us in the introduction of CML for the next or near
    release of their products. 

    <h2>12. IPRights and Protection</h2>
    CML and its logo is trademarked to protect its status as a name and to
    ensure integrity. This reflects similar practice for other languages (e.g.
    CIF). To ensure openness of use all CML specifications and software are
    published as OpenSource with appropriate licences to protect integrity but
    ensure wide distribution. There is no intention to patent the CML
    specification and software.
