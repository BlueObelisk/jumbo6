    <h3>Abstract:</h3>

    <p>We present an overview of the current state of public
    semantic chemistry and propose new approaches at a strategic
    and a detailed level. We show by example how a model for a
    chemical semantic web can be constructed using
    machine-processed data and information from journal
    articles.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The last ten years of the Internet as a medium for
    information exchange have created huge expectations in the
    general public. People look to the Web as their first (and
    often only) source of information and increasingly expect it to
    be delivered automatically. Novel forms abound, such as
    wireless technology, smart clothes and personal (music)
    devices. Many communities (media, finance, music, government)
    are making rapid advances in conveying instant services or
    information. One coherent vision of this new environment is
    epitomised by Berners-Lee's "Semantic Web" (SW)<sup>1</sup>
    where knowledge is instantly available and computers as well as
    humans can reason from it to make decisions.</p>

    <p>The ethos of the Semantic Web is well summed up by two
    quotations from J. D. Bernal, made almost 40 years
    ago<sup>2</sup>;</p>

    <blockquote>
      "However large an array of facts, however rapidly they
      accumulate, it is possible to keep them in order and to
      extract from time to time digests containing the most
      generally significant information, while indicating how to
      find those items of specialized interest. To do so, however,
      requires the will and the means"
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "[we need to] get the best information in the minimum
      quantity in the shortest time, from the people who are
      producing the information to the people who want it,
      <b>whether they know they want it or not</b>" (our emphasis).
    </blockquote>

    <p>Meanwhile the power of computation (speed, memory, bandwidth
    and software) continues to increase at Moore's-law speed. An
    impressive chemical use of the Internet and high-throughput
    computing was demonstrated by Richards and
    co-workers<sup>3</sup>. To quote from their site</p>

    <blockquote>
      Anyone, anywhere with access to a personal computer, could
      help find a cure for cancer by giving "screensaver time" from
      their computers to the world's largest ever computational
      project, which will screen 3.5 billion molecules for
      cancer-fighting potential [...] over 2.6 million computers
      have joined the project with over 320,000 years of CPU power
      used ... Through a process called "virtual screening",
      special analysis software will identify molecules that
      interact with these proteins ... The process is similar to
      finding the right key to open a special lock - by looking at
      millions upon millions of molecular keys.
    </blockquote>

    <p>At a recent meeting,<sup>4</sup> Richards in his
    presentation of this project made a request to the chemical
    community to collaborate in utilising this immense computer
    power, which "for the first time in my scientific career is
    more than we alone can make use of." This particular project
    illustrates the concept of the Grid, a linking of vast
    computational power for immediate use. In science this is
    anticipated by the construction of the Global Grid (and
    nationally in the UK, the eScience project) where instant
    access to trusted information and services is possible. The
    combination of the Grid and the Semantic Web is seen as
    culminating in a Semantic Grid, in which vast power and
    knowledge are combined.</p>

    <p>Much classical chemical knowledge has in turn been built on
    what is described as "data mining". For example, all chemists
    are familiar with the concepts introduced by the likes of
    Mendeleev, Trouton, Barton (Conformational analysis), Woodward
    (Pericyclic reactions) etc. At the time of these discoveries,
    the scientific literature was sufficiently small and these
    concepts were sufficiently focused that any necessary
    supporting data could be feasibly extracted from the literature
    by human labour alone. In 1973 Burgi and Dunitz<sup>5</sup>
    showed that the measured geometries of a range of similar
    compounds could map a reaction pathway, such as N...C=O
    addition. With the technology and access to data available at
    the time, it could typically take several months to extract
    sufficient information for a single system. In 1976 this
    process was revolutionised by introduction of crystallographic
    data files, which made coordinates available to the scientific
    community. This led to the possibility of automatically
    computing and mining many hundreds of geometries in a few
    minutes and which speeded such studies by several orders of
    magnitude. Using this technology it proved possible to
    show<sup>6</sup> that the intermolecular interactions involving
    O...I-C substructures were directional; this relied on
    computation of many crystal lattices and searching the
    substructures. There are now around 1000 articles describing
    the use of the crystallographic data file for primary
    scientific research.</p>

    <p>One further example serves to illustrate how the
    availability of appropriate data has influenced development of
    new techniques. Thus parametric semi-empirical quantum
    mechanical methods rely on a well-distributed set of molecules
    and data. The development of early semi-empirical MO
    parameterisations in the 1970's was based on (manual and
    laborious)<sup>7</sup> acquisition of data for at most 10-20
    molecules per element parametrised. Nowadays<sup>8</sup> such
    parametrisations are conducted using datasets for 1500 or more
    molecules, and the bottleneck is now more likely to be the
    validation and checking for self consistency and validity of
    the data used.</p>

    <p>However, these various projects are not general or easily
    copied. The Cancer project<sup>4</sup> for example had to
    provide most of its infrastructure and is based on uniformity
    of data (proteins/ligands) and (proprietary) software. The
    chemical community needs to be able to operate on a wide range
    of problems without having to engineer each of them separately;
    in effect there is a need to incorporate semantics and
    ontologies into a generic set of tools for this purpose. Here
    we suggest that the Semantic Web can provide such an
    infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>The Chemical Semantic Web: Characteristics</h2>

    <p>The domain-independent infrastructure of the semantic web is
    becoming omnipresent through <i>de facto</i> standards (mainly
    from W3C<sup>9</sup>) such as XML (eXtensible Markup language),
    RDF (Resource description framework) for relationships, RSS
    (Rich-site Summary) and Dublin Core for metadata-based
    newsfeeds, OWL for ontologies and BPEL4WS for workflow and web
    services. It will shortly be possible to request a machine to
    discover existing knowledge or services and make appropriate
    transactions to obtain these, including security, trust, and
    metadata in a robust and efficient fashion. Its adoption will
    depend on "what there is to discover" and how valuable it is.
    We have variously argued<sup>10</sup> that chemistry is an
    almost ideal discipline for transition to such a next
    generation of informatics infrastructure; a Chemical Semantic
    Web. This in turn would be supported by domain-specific <i>de
    facto</i> standards such as the CML (Chemical Markup Language)
    family<sup>11,12</sup>.</p>

    <p>In this article we argue that primary publications in this
    and similar journals should form a major substrate for such a
    chemical semantic web. When rendered machine-understandable, in
    the form of what we have termed datuments<sup>13</sup>,
    journals will form the future knowledge base for the
    discipline. For simplicity we shall restrict ourselves in this
    article to small organic molecules, their properties and
    reactions. However the philosophy extends directly to
    computational, structural, thermo-, analytical and much
    inorganic and physical chemistry. The technology exists; it is
    up to the community to support the vision.</p>

    <p>The Semantic Web and the emergence of Grid computing involve
    a qualitative change not only in the way that we manage
    information but in the way that science is carried out. We see
    computers becoming an integral part of the scientific process
    in many ways, in helping to;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Establish data quality</b>. Scientific information
        can be corrupted during the publication process. Thus
        Stewart<sup>8</sup> has shown that in a comparison of
        calculated and observed thermodynamic data at NIST, many of
        the discrepancies were due to publication or transcription
        errors. Using the OSCAR publication checker<sup>14</sup>
        (which analyses data for self-consistency and acceptable
        ranges) it has been shown that a very high proportion of
        articles in synthetic organic chemistry contain at least
        one dubious data value. We note however that much of the
        (explicit or implicit) data in the current publication
        processes are created and maintained on or by machines. If
        the protocols are well agreed, then the data are implicitly
        machine-understandable. When machine-referees are used for
        data they have made valuable contributions. This is
        particularly true in areas such as crystallography, where
        crystallographic structures are routinely reviewed by
        programs which encapsulate more expertise than most humans,
        and e.g. thermophysical property databases<sup>15</sup>
        where management of data quality can be enforced. The
        biosciences are also used to running automatic processes
        over data of imperfect quality. For example many of the
        ligands in the Protein DataBank have fuzzy structures
        (imperfect coordinates, unknown charge, unlocated hydrogen
        atoms, etc.) Yet it is felt highly valuable to create
        resources derived from these such as PDBSum, HIC-UP,
        LigPlot and many others. These authors certainly wish
        access to as much data as possible and will use their
        judgments and robots to decide on how to process it.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Allow validation</b>. Much chemical information is
        imprecisely defined. Scientific units are often omitted
        (<i>e.g.</i> in computational chemistry log files) and
        information can be interpreted differently by different
        readers. XML provides a basis for <i>validating</i>
        information. An XMLSchema<sup>12</sup> can require
        conformance to a given vocabulary, document structure,
        datatypes and data values and associated limits
        (uncertainties). Thus a valid CML<sup>11,12</sup> document
        must: 

        <ul>
          <li>Use elementTypes from a given enumeration
          (<i>e.g.</i> the IUPAC periodic table).</li>

          <li>Require hydrogen counts to be explicit and to be
          non-negative integers.</li>

          <li>Require that any molecule with bonds also includes
          atoms.</li>
        </ul>
        Any schema-aware XML tool can carry out this validation; a
        chemical application is not required. Even greater power
        (<i>e.g.</i> valence constraint) can be provided by
        ontologically-aware tools such as RDF and OWL. We are
        developing tools<sup>12</sup> whereby standard XML
        technology should be able to verify that any piece of
        chemical information was precise and made "basic chemical
        sense".
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Enable Re-usability</b>. A very high proportion of
        chemistry is potentially re-usable for scientific
        discovery, in several ways: 

        <ul>
          <li>Data can be combined with similar measurements on
          related systems (<i>e.g.</i> molecular geometries for
          different compounds can be compared).</li>

          <li>Multiple quantities (structure, properties,
          reactivity) relating to the same system can be
          aggregated.</li>

          <li>Missing or dubious properties can be calculated.</li>

          <li>Quantities can be recalculated as improved methods
          become available.</li>

          <li>Comparisons (<i>e.g.</i> QSAR) can be repeated as new
          classificatory methods become available.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Ensure comprehensiveness</b>. Most chemical data is
      never satisfactorily published due to the impedance of
      conventional processes. We estimate that less than a fifth of
      primary data ever has the possibility of being re-used</li>

      <li>
        <b>Add metadata</b>. Data can now carry metadata
        (information about data). In chemistry the most important
        types of metadata include: 

        <ul>
          <li>Identification of provenance, where the data came
          from, including an audit trail of past processes. Thus a
          molecular structure might have been built by a
          heuristics-based program, subjected to conformational
          analysis using specified methods, and re-optimised using
          declared procedures. All this metadata can and now should
          accompany published information.</li>

          <li>Discovery. Traditional methods have concentrated on
          keywords and classification for information retrieval.
          The success of full-content based searched (<i>e.g.</i>
          Google) highlight the possibility that computer-based
          methods of creating and storing discovery metadata will
          become common.</li>

          <li>Validation. These metadata allow the data to be
          evaluated as "fit for purpose". A common requirement is
          that error limits or uncertainty estimates are given. A
          good example is the formalisation of such quantities
          (using XML-dictionaries) for thermophysical and
          thermochemical property data.<sup>16</sup></li>

          <li>Semantic and ontological. Most data require
          additional instructions and annotation to describe them
          precisely. A "bond order" depends on the convention used
          and the author should supply links to the ontology used
          to describe the data.</li>
        </ul>
        In many cases, the most viable way of enforcing complete
        and unambiguous metadata reporting would be the development
        by the major journals of a software infrastructure guiding
        users through the process of data submission and providing
        consistency tools between various related data types. In
        some fields such as chemical thermodynamics, this is
        already being done.<sup>17</sup>
      </li>

      <li><b>Enable scale</b>. Computers can hold every piece of
      significant scientific data. The scales of data acquisition
      and processing in particle physics, biosciences, medical and
      geoimaging are far greater than in most chemical operations.
      With a generous assumption of 2 million public chemical
      entities/year, and 100 Mbyte of data/metadata for each
      (measurements, calculations, analytical, safety) requires 0.2
      petabyte/year. The Large Hadron Collider (in high energy
      physics) is already planning for 50 times this amount of data
      per year. The chemical community already has enough storage
      to hold the sum of chemical knowledge on its personal
      computers. Paradoxically, that is where most of it will
      remain until it decays, since in many ways it is not
      retrievable from this final resting place.</li>

      <li><b>Provide power</b>. A quantum mechanical calculation
      for a typical organic molecule (say at the B3LYP/631-G(d)
      Self-consistent-field molecular orbital level) can be done in
      a day on a single processor. Complete geometry optimisation
      for all published compounds could be done on chemists'
      workstations while they sleep. It would be technically
      possible for any report of a new compound to be accompanied
      by a re-usable calculation of its molecular properties.</li>

      <li><b>Allow distribution, immediacy and permanency</b>.
      Retrieval of distributed information is rapid and reliable
      and the next generation of Grid systems will provide "instant
      availability" of scientific information. We have described a
      protocol based on RSS (Rich-Site Summary) and XML and known
      as CMLRSS<sup>18</sup> whereby the results of <i>e.g.</i>
      chemical computations, crystal structure determinations,
      database additions or merely tables of contents from journals
      can be made available within minutes either to a human (for
      rapid scanning) or to another machine for <i>e.g.</i>
      aggregation. High throughput information from <i>e.g.</i>
      1000 compounds a day, each with 1 Mbyte of output can be
      "published" to digital libraries and other data portals,
      where the problems of archiving and curation can be addressed
      better than ourselves.</li>

      <li><b>Automation</b>. Humans can only respond to the
      exponential demand for and growth of data by automating their
      information processes. Nevertheless, high-throughput
      calculations on <i>e.g.</i> 200,000 molecules with an "error
      rate" of 0.1% still means 200 problems that a human must
      investigate. The protocols must therefore be completely
      automatic, allowing for and reacting to possible
      failures.</li>

      <li><b>Convenience and expertise</b>. The programs used to
      compute molecular properties almost invariably have manuals
      of several hundred pages, with an almost infinite combination
      of possible program options. When developing our automatic
      protocol (below) one of us (PM-R) made "elementary" mistakes
      (<i>e.g.</i> not requesting the program to use RAM instead of
      disk, and using an unnecessarily expensive and outdated
      method). We therefore asked the priesthood of computational
      chemistry (<i>e.g.</i> HSR) to devise a protocol which was
      automatic and more believable by the community. This process
      of developing and formalising the protocols allows for re-use
      by subsequent novices, hence providing for more
      (self)consistent data where outliers and trends can be more
      easily (and automatically) identified.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Chemical Semantic Web: Requirements</h2>

    <p>In this article we encourage chemists to develop a shared
    vision whereby information is communal and accessible. It is
    important to realise that <i>all information</i> is potentially
    valuable and that the producers may not realise at the time
    what their descendants will require. We argue that the
    technologies and protocols presented here can be implemented at
    marginal cost within the publication process, if the community
    desires. This approach is not novel in other domains.</p>

    <p>It is a truism that the Web develops in unpredictable ways,
    but we believe that the success of Google and related search
    engines suggest that client-based discovery is likely to be a
    key component. In principle a "chemical Google" could be
    extremely effective and completely change the basis of chemical
    information management; in practice there are substantial
    cultural and technical barriers. We explore these in this
    article and urge all chemists (authors, editors, readers,
    examiners, funders, businesses and agencies) to consider how a
    change in practice could lead to much greater use and re-use of
    chemical information.</p>

    <p>Chemical information as based on molecules and compounds is
    the cornerstone of the Chemical Semantic web. Friedlich
    Beilstein<sup>19</sup> created a revolution in scientific
    informatics by introducing the data model of
    Compound-Properties-Source as far back as the 1860s!
    Effectively this concept still remains relevant today and is
    the basis of a multimillion informatics market, with near
    comprehensive abstraction of all new compounds and their
    properties from the primary literature. Whilst various modern
    aspects of chemistry extend this simple concept to the limit,
    especially those where the bonding is debatable or the
    chemistry is novel, "most" organic chemical structures are very
    well defined. For example it is possible to specify these in
    patents and have rigorous procedures for determining
    equivalences. The crystalline state is also well characterised
    for many applications and the International Unions (IUPAC,
    IUPAB and IUCr) have important ongoing projects to systematise
    chemical representation. XML<sup>9</sup> has become recognised
    as an essential specification for markup languages. Chemical
    Markup Language (CML)<sup>11,12</sup> itself was specifically
    developed as XML-conforming language to support the communality
    of agreement within the community and to allow divergence of
    representation when it is essential. In broad terms, the CML
    design allows support for molecules and their properties and is
    becoming adopted by a wide range of organisations (Patents,
    publishers, government agencies and software manufacturers).
    The fundamental architecture of CML contains no molecular
    concepts that are not in current use, and we showed some time
    ago that it is possible to publish complete journal articles
    using various XML components such as CML.<sup>20</sup> Other
    examples of XML-languages being used in this manner include
    MathML and ThermoML,<sup>21</sup> the latter developed by NIST
    (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) as part of
    their role in measuring and aggregating data for compounds.
    Most information however is still micro-published and has to be
    tediously (and expensively) extracted by humans. In contrast,
    the biosciences have developed an open model where much
    publication is directly to the public electronic domain, there
    being no distinction between the data in a published article
    and its representation in an international database such as
    SwissProt or the Protein Databank. Indeed the latter may be of
    more value, as the data can be annotated at intervals, whilst
    the original publication is "inviolate" but often dated.</p>

    <h3>Open Access Initiatives</h3>

    <p>The current generation of Semantic Web tools require access
    to information and services with effectively no barrier. If a
    machine wishes to retrieve a unit of information, it cannot at
    present login to a protected web site (even without cost), make
    (micro) payments, or verify that it is not violating copyright
    or other intellectual property rights. Semantic Web
    applications can therefore only currently be built upon
    publicly accessible Web resources. It seems appropriate
    therefore to raise at this stage the issue of what is termed
    Open Access (OA), purely here in the context of the Chemical
    Semantic Web. The OA model is epitomised by the <i>Budapest
    Open Access Initiative</i><sup>22</sup>, which includes the
    following definitions:</p>

    <blockquote>
      By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free
      availability on the public internet, permitting any users to
      read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to
      the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing,
      pass them as data to software, or use them for any other
      lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical
      barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to
      the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and
      distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain,
      should be to give authors control over the integrity of their
      work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.
    </blockquote>

    <p>The OA model is supported by funders such as the Wellcome
    Trust<sup>23</sup>, which</p>

    <blockquote>
      [...] therefore supports open and unrestricted access to the
      published output of research, including the open access model
      as a fundamental part of its charitable mission and a public
      benefit to be encouraged wherever possible.
    </blockquote>

    <p>and organisations such as NIST, who are promoting OA models
    of efficient data re-use (using XML technology) between
    themselves, major journals and industry.<sup>24</sup></p>

    <p>At present the primary chemical literature is not openly
    accessible on the Internet. There are currently 33 chemistry
    journals cited by the Directory of Open Access
    Journals<sup>25</sup> as Open Access, and none of them are
    currently major publishers (<i>e.g.</i> from G8 nations). In a
    dissenting opinion, the American Chemical Society has
    argued<sup>26</sup> that:</p>

    <blockquote>
      The open-access movement's demand that an entirely new and
      unproven model for STM publishing be adopted is not in the
      best interests of science.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Many chemistry publishers also currently prohibit the public
    self-archiving<sup>27</sup> of "fulltext", preprints or
    postprints. Very recently however, the Royal Society of
    Chemistry (publisher of this journal) announced<sup>28</sup> an
    official "Green" policy on author self-archiving of articles
    published in RSC journals. In this spirit, this article has
    itself been self-archived on the authors' own institutional
    archives.<sup>29</sup></p>

    <p>We restrict ourselves here to a plea that all primary
    chemical <i>data</i> be made openly available at time of
    publication. We emphasize "data" since "facts" are not
    copyrightable under the Berne convention, and primary
    publishers have little incentive or success in publishing the
    complete data associated with an article. In fact the current
    publication process is a dis-incentive to publishing
    experimental data. It is also notable that most supplemental
    data is not in re-usable form (often being found as Word or PDF
    files or as scanned images). In the case of crystallographic
    data it is often only available from the (non-open) Cambridge
    Crystallographic Data Centre. This results in further
    restrictions on access and re-use.</p>

    <p>We therefore argue for publication <i>by the author</i> of
    data under Open Access protocols to a public or institutional
    repository. We appreciate that this change will take time, and
    involves investment in technology. It is, however, not novel,
    being a requirement in the biosciences for protein and nucleic
    acid sequences and structures and is common in many other
    areas. Whatever policy is adopted by publishers, it is
    essential that it is made clear to both human and robot readers
    and re-users what may be done with published articles. We
    therefore list below a series of issues for resolution and
    clarification.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Extraction of factual data. We quote a legal opinion cited
        by the Open Crystallography Database<sup>30</sup>, where
        many similar issues are addressed: 

        <blockquote>
          I [*] assume US law governs throughout; an inaccurate but
          necessary assumption here. If you extract only the actual
          coordinate data you have no copyright liability. One
          cannot copyright facts, only the expression incident to
          factual reporting. This principle was recognized by the
          US Supreme Court in 1915 with respect to news reports
          sent by telegraph. The idea/expression distinction has
          been held by the Supreme Court to prevent assertion of
          copyright over telephone white pages, where there is no
          originality in the concept of alphabetic organization of
          data. More complex forms of association or organization
          of data might give rise to claims.
        </blockquote>

        <p>By analogy, properties such as melting points, spectra,
        refractive indexes, and similar measurements are also
        facts. We therefore assume that by default humans can
        abstract and repurpose factual information (generally
        referred to as "data" in this article) without seeking
        copyright permission. We believe that this is current
        practice among many secondary data producers. We see no
        logical reason why robots cannot perform the same task. By
        default, therefore, if the owner/controller of a robot has
        access to one or more publications, their robots can
        extract the facts from these publications and re-use the
        collected information freely. We ask that publishers
        confirm that no copyright is violated in the extraction and
        reuse of factual information by robotic methods where the
        user has legitimate access to the information.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Re-use of supplemental data. We show below that, at
        least for crystallography, the re-use of supplemental data
        is highly valuable, but the access to and copyright status
        of it varies from journal to journal. We would assert that
        it consisted of facts, but for many journals, the same
        copyright notice that applies to the primary article also
        by default covers the supplemental information. Whilst the
        experience of the present authors (HSR) suggests that
        requests to publishers for a more open non-exclusive
        copyright status for supplemental data are often granted,
        we suspect this is not common. We believe that the
        motivation behind the deposition of supplemental data is to
        make it available to the community for re-use, but that
        many authors do not realise the concerns of copyright. We
        ask that publishers confirm that their supplemental data,
        whether held by them or by a third party is freely reusable
        by humans and robots.</p>
      </li>

      <li>In some cases it is not clear whether the supplemental
      data provided (<i>e.g.</i> by a publisher or data aggregator)
      is the original author's or has been creatively enhanced
      (<i>e.g.</i> by editing). We ask that publishers make it
      clear whether the changes have taken place, what their nature
      is, and if so to provide a copy of the author's original data
      for re-use.</li>

      <li>We also suggest that authors add a declaration in their
      manuscript and/or supplemental data that the data is freely
      readable and re-usable by humans or robots. We expect that
      The Creative Commons Science Project<sup>31</sup> is likely
      to provide useful protocols.</li>

      <li>We have noted that robotic indexing of publishers' sites
      may be discouraged (there may be valid reasons such as denial
      of service). We ask that publishers have a policy to allow
      known robots from the scientific community to access, index
      and extract publicly available facts from their sites.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We hope to collect the views of major publishers of
    chemistry on these questions. We appreciate the effort required
    to addressing these concerns but feel that solutions are
    essential if there is to be a thriving Open chemical
    information process, on which applications such as the semantic
    Web can be built.</p>

    <h2>Examples of the Chemical Semantic Web</h2>

    <p>In the second part of this article, we will proceed to show
    that our vision is realisable with today's technology and take
    as example the high-throughput computation of the properties of
    molecules published in the present journal (Organic and
    Biological Chemistry). Our general approach takes the form
    shown in Figure 1.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/ob/b4/b410732b/original/figure1.html" title="Figure 1" target="external"><img src="repglob_files/Figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a><br>
     <b>Figure 1</b>. Schematic for Capturing and processing data
    from journal articles.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>We assume a molecule is precisely identifiable from the
      text (systematic IUPAC-like name) or supplemental data
      (connection table) of the publication. The adoption of the
      IUPAC/NIST unique molecular identifier (INChI)<sup>32</sup>
      will make this automatic.</li>

      <li>We use a parser (JUMBOName) to generate the connection
      table (in CML)<sup>12</sup> including stereochemistry. These
      steps would become unnecessary if authors used INChI is used
      to describe molecules.</li>

      <li>3D coordinates (in CML) are generated from the connection
      table, or converted from published 3D structures (<i>e.g.</i>
      CIF) to CML.</li>

      <li>We use a semi-empirical SCF-MO method or molecular
      mechanics procedure for rapid optimisation.</li>

      <li>This processed molecule is then submitted into a
      high-throughput computation system for more accurate
      calculation of properties.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In most cases the "legacy" input can be converted
    automatically to CML and input to the computational process.
    The results can be repurposed in several ways, including
    storage in an XML repository. If the authoring process is
    converted to using XML, then the whole chain can be seamless. A
    typical XML-based process in shown in Figure 2. This will then
    allow the complete material in a primary publications to be
    used as a global knowledge base.</p>

    <h3>Structural Chemiotics</h3>

    <p>Before describing how content can be transferred from the
    "pages" of current journals into a semantically rich
    environment, it is worth considering how such semantics are
    currently represented in journal form. We focus on organic
    chemistry, which still rests securely on many of the concepts
    developed in the nineteenth century. In our XML-based formalism
    of chemistry<sup>12</sup>, many of the core concepts
    (<i>e.g.</i> atoms, bonds, electrons etc) would have been
    understood by an early 20th century chemist. The representation
    of more complete chemical entities, substances, and reactions
    has however also remained substantially unchanged. In
    particular chemists have learnt to communicate many concepts
    graphically, and until around 20 years ago these were
    necessarily restricted to the printed page.</p>

    <p>In 1984 the introduction of <i>e.g.</i> the ChemDraw program
    provided arguably the first widely available mechanism for
    transfer of chemical ideas between computer and the printed
    page in a graphical form; concurrently, physical and
    theoretical chemists were starting to use programs such as
    LaTeX for handling equations. The key point is that these
    "electronic chemical stencils" did not change, and in fact
    reinforced, conventional (and often ambiguous) symbolism. In
    some cases the programs were designed to display excellently on
    paper, only adequately on the screen and much less so within
    formal data-structures. The creators of such programs often
    constrain the chemical author to a finite set of chemical
    glyphs with the consequence that semiotic innovation is thereby
    not encouraged.</p>

    <p>Tools for the display of three-dimensional chemical objects
    have created enhanced chemiotics such as the Connolly surface,
    and the rendering of quantum mechanical concepts ("orbital
    photography"), which thereby became more accessible to
    chemists. But molecular structure and reactivity has largely
    remained rooted at the "arrow-pushing" level. Determination of
    the electron counts and configurations in a molecule often
    requires significant work, accompanied by the perception of
    many implicit semantics</p>

    <p>Overall therefore, we conclude that almost all current
    chemiotics is "fuzzy", it requires considerable experience to
    interpret it and an induction into the priesthood. There are
    frequent misunderstandings, often only resolvable by a deep
    knowledge of the chemistry of substances and reactions. It is
    "known" that in many structures hydrogen atoms are to be added,
    and in others not. For steroids the stereochemistry at centres
    is deducible "by analogy". Reactants are frequently inferred
    from textual annotations such as "aqueous workup". Carbon atoms
    are/not assumed where "bonds cross". These implicit semantics
    are difficult, dangerous and impossible for machines to
    understand. The discussion that follows illustrates how some of
    these difficult issues arise and where they can be
    addressed.</p>

    <h2>Case studies of current publications</h2>

    <h3>Methodology and Analysis</h3>

    <p>We have chosen to illustrate the potential for the Chemical
    Semantic Web by analysing the current articles in this journal
    (June 2004). We show the potential for machine analysis,
    although here have deliberately carried it out manually as the
    RSC journals site restricts web trawling to Google (see
    editorial comment associated with this article). In principle,
    everything reported here would be scalable with robots. We have
    also tried to emulate the Web access of a non-subscriber
    (<i>i.e.</i> emulating what is available Openly). This also
    attempts to ensure that we do not abuse our subscription
    access.</p>

    <p>For the OBC journal, (Graphical) abstracts of all articles,
    3-4 free articles per issue and Supplemental data for a
    proportion of the articles is publicly available. We confine
    ourselves to articles reporting compounds (new or re-used) and
    their properties or reactions, addressing the perspectives of
    Human understandability and implicit semantics, the machine
    understandability of <i>data in articles</i> and the machine
    understandability of supplemental data. Our corpus is therefore
    comprises two openly readable articles<sup>33,34</sup> and 24
    (closed) advance articles, with graphical abstracts and
    optionally supplemental data. We have taken, as they appear,
    the first two articles together with one graphical abstract and
    supplemental data from several others. Authors and editors
    should not take this as specific criticism but simply as a
    sample of the current state of the art of graphical
    representation.</p>

    <h3>Transformation using Journal articles as source</h3>

    <p>The first article<sup>33</sup> is a review of chemical
    reactivity in a synthetic context. It does not report details
    of individual molecules and the chemistry is almost entirely
    graphically based, so the article has no chemical
    machine-understandability. Some issues arising from this are
    shown by a typical snapshot (Figure 3).</p>

    <p><img src="repglob_files/Figure3.jpg" alt="Figure 3" border="1" width="800"><br>
     <b>Figure 3.</b> Two illustrative reaction sequences taken
    from ref 33.</p>

    <p>These reactions have almost certainly been authored using a
    computer, but are aimed for human, not machine
    understandability. Their layout is dictated not by chemical
    practice but the requirement to use two columns in a
    width-limited display constrained by journal paper sizes.
    Assuming the 2D coordinates of the graphics primitives were
    available in machine-readable form, a machine could, with
    sufficient heuristics, understand the content of the left hand
    frame, but the right-hand one is effectively impossible. The
    machine must recognise that the species over the arrow is a
    stoichiometric reagent, that the "+" means "mixture of" and
    that the text actually represents a two column/two row table.
    "TEA" and "Alk" are not explicitly defined. It is therefore
    unrealistic to expect machines to understand published
    reactions without new approaches (see below).</p>

    <p>Machine-readable molecules (<i>i.e.</i> with connection
    tables) should, however be almost completely tractable. However
    a consistent approach is critical; significant variability of
    stereochemical representation within a single article and even
    within a single molecule can often be observed. Here four
    different conventions are used<sup>33</sup> for the same
    concept (a hatched "wedge" bond, Figure 4).</p>

    <p><img src="repglob_files/Figure4.jpg" alt="Figure 4"><br>
     <b>Figure 4</b>. Stereochemical notatations taken from ref
    26.</p>

    <p>In <b>1</b> (our numbering), the stereochemistry can only be
    interpreted if it is assumed that the wide end of the hatched
    wedge is the chiral atom. In <b>2</b> no chiral atom is
    indicated, the reader needing to know that a carbonyl cannot be
    stereogenic. In <b>3</b> the solid wedged bonds have a
    different convention from <b>2</b> and <i>three</i> different
    conventions are used for the hatched wedge bonds. One stereo
    centre is not annotated (presumably the ring junction is
    assumed to be <i>cis</i> but the reader must know the
    conformational energetics of small rings.) Another centre is
    decorated with wedge and hatch bonds even though it is not
    stereogenic. In <b>4a</b> and <b>4b</b>, two stereoisomers are
    presumably indicated by the <i>positions</i> of bonds rather
    than a stereochemical convention.</p>

    <p>A machine would be incapable of making these judgements. The
    diagrams have, however, almost certainly been created in a
    drawing program and can easily be analysed for validity and
    consistency using the IUPAC/NIST INChI program.<sup>32</sup> We
    show this process being used for molecule <b>3</b> . INChi
    reads a connection table, normalizes it (<i>i.e.</i> for
    different approaches to aromaticity), detects possible
    tautomerism and other possible variations and uniquely labels
    all atoms (Figure 5). It also generates a unique string or XML
    (shown later) which can be used for indexing or editing and as
    a machine understandable connection table. The message from
    this article, therefore, is that if authors use tools to
    create, <i>validate</i>, and publish their structures, a high
    degree of machine understandability can be achieved.</p>

    "correct" stereochemistry.</p>

    <p>The second article<sup>34</sup> reports around 20 novel
    compounds. They are reported in a concise, human-readable but
    not very human-friendly form (Figures 6 and 7).</p>

     <b>Figure 7</b>. A typical experimental section, illustrating
    the relatively structured nature of the data descriptions.</p>

    <p>Figure 6 contains much information, but it is a considerable
    effort to read. The reader first has to work out the semantics,
    which are that a series of related compounds are transformed by
    a series of reagents to a series of products. None of the
    identities of the compounds are explicit and have to be deduced
    by decoding the generic Markush-like substitutions. Note that
    not all compounds in a series follow the same paths. Only the
    starting compounds have the complete structural framework; the
    rest have cutaway diagrams. The reason for this is primarily to
    save space in the conventional representation. Although not
    explicit, we assume that the metal in the intermediates is
    coordinated to all 4 N atoms. Note also that the reagents are
    not explicitly given, but have to be decoded from the caption,
    again mandated by the need to save space.</p>

    <p>The scheme is not machine-understandable but it is augmented
    by the running text and analytical data (Figure 7) which are.
    These were not given in the main text for all numbered
    compounds, but additional material was provided in the
    supplemental data. Using the OSCAR program<sup>14</sup> the
    data for the 10 compounds in the text was robotically
    translated into CML and is shown as a summary (Table 1).</p>

    <p>It is clear that a large amount of high-quality information,
    including molecular formula and spectral peaks can be
    understood. Unfortunately no connection tables are given, and
    the names cannot be interpreted, as the authors have just
    coined many of them. The publication would again be enormously
    enhanced by the generation of INChI identifiers<sup>32</sup>
    for all the unique molecules. This process is illustrated below
    for four of these compounds involved in one of the
    transformations (reagent v, Figure 6) and believed to be
    <b>7bH2, 8BNi, 11</b> (a generic label?), and <b>10bNi</b>)
    These were redrawn by us using a CML-aware editor
    (Marvin<sup>35</sup>), saved as MOL files and CML files and the
    INChI identifiers generated from these (Table 2).</p>

    <h3>Transformation using Supplemental data as source.</h3>

    <p>We examined 24 advance articles but restricted ourselves to
    the publicly (and therefore robotically) visible material,
    which included the graphical abstract, and any supplemental
    data. All the articles had a graphical abstract, but only 14
    had supplemental data. The latter was examined for
    machine-understandability (<i>i.e.</i> could a machine, given
    the likely nature of the data, extract a useful amount of
    material). Disappointingly, most supplemental data is not
    machine-understandable and a lot is not human-readable either,
    with images reduced below the resolution of the pixel grid. Two
    examples of this latter phenomenon (Figure 8 and 9) clearly
    show that the data was originally completely
    machine-understandable, but that the publication process has
    destroyed this by rendering on (physical) paper (note the
    presence of human annotations in both). It is worth emphasizing
    that not all supplemental data is so emasculated; that
    associated with <i>e.g.</i> ref 17 could in some ways be
    considered a superset of the main article, since an (XML-based)
    transformation of the supplemental information would in fact
    regenerate the formal article.</p>

    <p><img src="repglob_files/Figure8.jpg" alt="Figure 8"><br>

    information, illustrating the human annotations and lack of

     <b>Figure 9</b>. Mass spectral data provided as supplemental
    information, illustrating human annotations and lack of machine
    readability.</p>

    <p>The only usable machine-understandable supplemental data
    provided within these 24 advance articles is a crystal
    structure attached as a CIF file to an advance
    publication<sup>36</sup>. The molecule of interest is indicated
    as a raster image in the electronic abstract (Figure 10). This
    is shown full (Websize) at left and magnified right. Again this
    was (once) machine-understandable; the loss of information is
    due to conversion to a gif for web viewing, and adoption of a
    customary size for graphical abstracts.</p>
    <img src="repglob_files/Figure10.jpg" alt="Figure 10"><br>
     <b>Figure 10</b>. Graphical abstract for article 29, shown
    original size (left) and magnified (right). 

    <p>Using the CIF provided by the original authors however, we
    believe that we have robotically extracted both the connection
    table and the 3D coordinates of a single molecule, using the
    following processing sequence.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Read the CIF into an XMLDOM<sup>37</sup> (our cif2cml
      library)</li>

      <li>discard minor disordered components.</li>

      <li>convert fractional coordinates to cartesian</li>

      <li>join bonds using "reasonable" covalent radii.</li>

      <li>apply symmetry operations to generate the minimum number
      of molecular fragments (here two, as the molecule is a dimer
      in the crystal.</li>

      <li>generate a connection table (CT) for the molecule(s)</li>

      <li>check against chemical formula (often not given)</li>

      <li>analyse the CT(s) with INChI to assess chemical
      validity.</li>

      <li>identify potential stereogenic atoms and bonds.</li>

      <li>generate CML <tt>atomParity</tt> and <tt>bondStereo</tt>
      if appropriate.</li>

      <li>use the CDK library<sup>38</sup> to generate conventional
      "2D" coordinates.</li>

      <li>Serialize the result as CML.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This process is not foolproof as CIFs do not in general
    report molecular charges, and any disorder may be difficult to
    interpret. In the current case there are no problems. The CML
    file was then robotically input to the MOPAC2002 program to
    invoke a PM5 calculation<sup>8</sup> (43 sec, done during the
    time it takes a human to read the abstract and the first
    paragraph of the article) to generate optimised gas-phase
    coordinates which were then subsequently input for
    GAMESS-US<sup>39</sup> <i>ab initio</i> re-optimisation. The
    result was used to generate an INChI identifier and then
    stored, without loss, in an XML repository (already containing
    around 250,000 other molecules processed using these automated
    procedures). This process has also provided two useful ring
    fragments for addition to <i>e.g.</i> a fragment database. All
    output from these programs was parsed into CML; the resulting
    molecules are shown in Figure 11.</p>

    <p>Finally, all new molecular entries can be added
    automatically to a CMLRSS newsfeed<sup>18</sup> which allows
    subscribers to this feed to receive up-to-date information
    about the entry, including any generated 2D/3D coordinates and
    associated information.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Reactions</h2>

    <p>The representation of molecules and compounds is relatively
    standard and primarily needs standardisation and discipline.
    Chemical reactions, however, are more challenging. There are
    relatively few tools for authoring chemical reactions, and
    those are not as widely used as those for molecules, being
    usually closely bound to non-interoperable proprietary software
    products. We believe that new approaches for representing
    chemical reactions are required and that these should move away
    from "paper-based" approaches. We present here an approach to
    chemical reactions that we believe should benefit both the
    human and machine reuse.</p>

    <p>Even confining ourselves to ground state species, a single
    reaction can involve, at many levels of detail:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The precise description of the trajectory of atomic
      ensembles on the potential energy surface</li>

      <li>The identification of two local minima and an intervening
      transition state</li>

      <li>The identities of reactant species and product
      species</li>

      <li>multiple successive or alternative reaction steps within
      a "reaction"</li>

      <li>The overall stoichiometry of a process, perhaps with
      associated physical data (heats, rates)</li>

      <li>The procedures required to carry it out, and the results
      and observations obtained.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition the term reaction is often used to mean a
    reaction type (<i>e.g.</i> esterification) where generic groups
    replace present atomic configurations. or a reaction scheme,
    whereby a set of reactions is laid out to show an overall
    synthetic strategy or enzymatic cascade.</p>

    <p>We have extended CML to support these concepts ("CMLReact")
    and tested it on several systems, most notably the MACiE
    database of enzyme reactions<sup>40</sup>. The CMLReact scheme
    includes XML constructions for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>reactant, product, spectator (<i>e.g.</i> protein side
      chains) or substance (which can include solvent, catalysts,
      etc.)</li>

      <li>mechanism and transition state.</li>

      <li>annotations (<i>e.g.</i> titles, names and labels).</li>

      <li>properties, both controlling conditions and
      observations/measurements</li>

      <li>Atoms, bonds and electrons. These can be explicitly
      included with a range of attributes (position, annotation,
      displayHints, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The conventional representation of a reaction with reactants
    and products may require a complex mapping of identities
    between them (<i>e.g.</i> atom-atom mapping and electron
    "movement" (curly arrows)) and CMLReact can support these.
    However CMLReact can also provide a much simpler approach, now
    described.</p>

    <p>If we discard the need for static paper, and allow the
    dynamism of the electronic medium, the information presentation
    becomes dramatically simpler. Atoms (and electrons) remain
    unaltered during a reaction so there is no need to replicate
    them. Even if there are several steps and many disjoint
    fragments (as in an enzyme mechanism) they are always present
    (even if conceptually at an "infinite distance"). We illustrate
    this with an example where only one "molecule" is involved -
    the biosynthesis of the steroid nucleus. The product, reactant
    and intermediate configurations were sketched with a
    conventional editor and saved as CML. These were then converted
    into individual SVG<sup>9</sup> documents (Figure 12) and
    combined using the SVG "animate" feature for the morphing into
    an animated SVG by processing with the CMLSnap XSLT<sup>9</sup>
    stylesheet.</p>
    <a href="http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/ob/b4/b410732b/original/figure12.html" title="Figure 12" target="external"><img src="repglob_files/Figure12.jpg" alt="Figure 12"></a><br>
     

    <p><b>Figure 12</b>. SVG-format diagrams generated using XML
    stylesheet transformation from CML. An animated version of this
    diagram is available via the XHTML version of this article.</p>
    <!--embed src="images/steroid.svg" width="500"
                                            height="300" /><br />
                                             <b>Figure 13</b>.  -->

    <p>The first three steps are stylised conformational
    rearrangements but the final one involves bond breaking and
    formation (Figure 12). Instead of using curly arrows, the bonds
    simply appear, disappear or change order. There are many ways
    in which this display can be personalised or enhanced. No
    special tools are required and the authoring time is at least
    as short as for conventional diagrams and requires no
    artificially imposed restrictions on layout.</p>

    <p>The same approach can be used to simplify the reaction
    scheme originally discussed and shown in Figure 6<sup>34</sup>.
    As an example we take the "main horizontal path" which involves
    the four species: 7bH2-&gt;8bNi-&gt;11bNi-&gt;10bNi. We make
    "snapshots" of these in the same coordinate frame (Figure 13),
    again created with a standard editor (Marvin)<sup>35</sup>.
    These frames can then be automatically combined into an
    animation with simple XSLT stylesheets and merged into a single
    SVG document. SVG provides automatic morphing so the graphic
    display shows a smooth transition between the species.</p>

    <p>Rather than use curly arrows, we can explicitly include
    significant electron pairs, as illustrated for a 5-step enzymic
    reaction<sup>40</sup> (Figure 14).</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/ob/b4/b410732b/original/figure14.html" title="Figure 14" target="external"><img src="repglob_files/Figure14.jpg" alt="Figure 14"></a><br>

    <p>Reaction procedures will also benefit from being cast into
    XML. The following proof-of concept cartoon<sup>41</sup>
    (Figure 15) shows the semantics of a chemical reaction
    procedure captured in XML and displayed by SVG animation. There
    is therefore great scope for changing the publication process
    for chemical reactions, but there is a need for standardisation
    and development of authoring tools.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions: A Manifesto for Open Chemistry</h2>

    <p>We believe the preceeding examples have shown that what
    advances there have been in the publication process over the
    last ten years are solely for human benefit; "electronic paper"
    is of little value to a machine. While much bioscience is
    published with the knowledge that machines will be expected to
    understand at least part of it, almost all chemistry is
    published purely for humans to read. This is compounded by the
    current business model in chemical information where authors do
    not deliberately publish information to be
    machine-understandable. With Chemical Abstracts and Beilstein,
    the traditional sequence of author&#8658;primary
    publisher&#8658;secondary publisher and the resale of data leads
    to an expectation that chemists will pay others to curate and
    collate their information.</p>

    <p>This was inevitable until recently, but we argue that now
    the author is often the best person to evaluate the data
    produced. Almost all of an author's output (compounds, spectra,
    reactions, properties, etc.) is nowadays computerised and in
    principle redistributable to the community for re-use. Few
    journals actively validate the primary data (<i>e.g.</i>
    spectra) involved in a publication (chemical crystallography
    being a clear expectation where data are intensively reviewed
    by machine). We reassert that chemists must now move towards
    publishing their collective knowledge in a systematic and
    easily accessible form for re-use and innovation</p>

    <p>The easiest part of this to implement is publication of
    (new) molecular entities and their associated properties. A
    molecule reported in this journal requires the statement of its
    precise chemical identity, the analytical data used to confirm
    its identity (including spectral information) and the procedure
    in which it was created or used (as a starting point or
    intermediate). We urge that authors, funders, editors,
    publishers and readers move further towards the following
    protocol:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All information should be ultimately
      machine-understandable in XML. Openly documented and reviewed
      XML data-centric languages include XHTML<sup>9</sup> (for
      running text), CML<sup>11,12</sup> (for molecular identity,
      including INChI, 2D structure and properties and 3D
      structures included when available), AniML<sup>42</sup>
      spectral and analytical data, STMML<sup>43</sup> for
      scientific datatypes and units and CatML<sup>44</sup> for
      managing catalyst information. In addition
      ThermoML<sup>21</sup> can be used for physicochemical
      data.</li>

      <li>Machine understandable information for a compound should
      include a connection table, the IUPAC unique identifier
      (INChI) which guarantees that the connection table can be
      checked and regenerated, and a name (although in principle
      this can be generated from the connection table, it helps to
      check consistency and trivial names may also be used). Where
      available, information about physical nature of the compound,
      scalar analytical quantities (melting point, refractive
      index, optical rotation), full real-domain spectra
      (<i>i.e.</i> "continuous" data) for appropriate nuclei, and
      vibrational spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometric
      data and elemental composition and aggregate formula should
      also be included.</li>

      <li>Rights metadata. An explicit statement in the data that
      its re-use is consistent with the Budapest Open Access
      initiative and a requirement that this statement be preserved
      when the data is re-used.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The actual process of this publication is primarily
    organisational. An increasing number of Open tools emit CML and
    will emit other XML schemas. XHTML tols are universal and Open
    tools for SVG are available. Other Open tools
    (OpenBabel,<sup>45</sup> JUMBO, CDK,<sup>38</sup>
    Joelib<sup>46</sup>) can convert legacy to and from CML, and
    support substructure searches. MathML<sup>9</sup> is supported
    by many vendors. Open Office<sup>47</sup> supports the general
    authoring of XML documents. Xindice<sup>48</sup> stores native
    XML documents in a searchable repository. The main challenge is
    for chemists to recognise the value of making their data
    machine-understandable, rather than destroying it with
    traditional paper or slide-focused publication and
    dissemination processes.</p>
