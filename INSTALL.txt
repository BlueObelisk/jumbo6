INSTALLATION
============

Jumbo is distributed as a source tree and collection of jars. It requires Java 1.5 but
should not require any specific installation. 

INCHI
=====

The InChI routines are not Java and distributed in jnInChI-0.1.1.jar. These should work 
on Windows and Linux - if not let us know.


HOW DO I USE JUMBO?
===================

Jumbo is a library, not an application and the main() routines are either for testing the schema, code
or data. The distribution will run under the Eclipse development kit. A good way to start is to
run all the unit tests (jumbo53 | rightClick | run as JUmnit tests)

You might look for unitTests that relate to your 
requirements. 

There are also two small test files in html/gettingStarted
