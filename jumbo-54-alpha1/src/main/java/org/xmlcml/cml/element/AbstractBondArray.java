/** A container for a number of bonds.

* 
* _bondArray_ is a child of _molecule_ and contains _bond_ information. There are two strategies:\n \nCreate individual bond elements under bondArray\n (in any order). This gives the greatest flexibility but is the most verbose.\n Create *Array attributes (e.g. of orderArrayType under \nbondArray. This requires all arrays to be of identical lengths with explicit values for all bonds in every array. This is NOT suitable for complexType bond children such as _bondStereo_ nor can IDs be added to bonds.. It also cannot be checked as easily by schema- and schematron validation. The _atomRef1Array_ and _atomRef2Array_ attributes are then mandatory. It is allowed (though not yet recommended) to add _*Array_ children such as _floatArray_\n \n\nThe attributes are directly related to the scalar attributes under _atom_ which should be consulted for more info.
